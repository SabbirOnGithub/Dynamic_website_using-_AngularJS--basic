# Dynamic_website_using-_AngularJS--basic

## Synopsis

This is a vary basic website using angularjs. I create this website for my learning purpose. I don't arrange file in a structured way, so forgive me for that.

## Code Example

In this website I practices AngularJS routing. This website has only four pages, they are **Home** , **About**, **Services**, **Contact**

## Motivation

AngularJS as a hot topic, I want to learn this thing, that's why I practice this website from a Tutorial.
